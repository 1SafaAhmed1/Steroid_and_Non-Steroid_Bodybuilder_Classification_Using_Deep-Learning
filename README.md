# Steroid_and_Non-Steroid_Bodybuilder_Classification_Using_Deep-Learning
 An Image classification system to detect Steroid and Non-steroid bodybuilders with RGB images using CNN-based Deep-learning to provide a reliable dope-testing alternative for sports organization committees and athletes.Firstly, a non- steroid and steroid bodybuilder image dataset of 4,231 RGB images was collected and cleaned. Next, we trained multiple pre- trained CNN models using this dataset. Lastly, we have reached reliable results with our pre-trained models, namely, our highest accuracy being 98.00% with InceptionV3 of epoch 30, and our lowest accuracy is 94.00% with Resnet50 of epoch 50, all other model results fall into this range. Finally, this is how our project provides an accurate Deep-learning Image classification system capable of steroid and non-steroid bodybuilder detection.
